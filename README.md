# SwingGUI-SendingEmail
Created a simple demo on using the swing GUI and how to create a working sending email.

You can Create your own new design of Swing GUI, for this I just created a simple email sender GUI with 5 TextField:To, CC, BCC, subject and
for the file. 1 TextArea for message and 2 buttons  for send file and send.

You can use here my given regex for the Email Validity : ?:^|[ ])([a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9_+&*-]+)*@(?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7})(?=$|[ ]
-This will validate and specifies a search pattern for an email format like sample@outlook.com

In any email sending, you should know what host you want in here I use outlook: "smtp.office365.com".
